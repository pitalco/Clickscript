# Clickscript

Clickscript (currently a work in progress) is a new, general purpose, visual programming language that allows non-coders to build software right along with software engineers that code.

Clickscript transpiles to Javascript allowing developers to pick up right where no-coders left off and vice-versa.

## Our Mission

If we are going to live in an ever growing digital & automated world, everyone is going to need to participate in building it. With ~28M software developers but ~5B software users, there is a massive chance of large future unemployment and minimal innovation if more builders cannot join the current builders in tech. Our mission is grand, and there's a large chance of failure, but someone has to try it. :) 

## Roadmap
- Alpha: UI for building Clickscript files & take Clickscript and transpile to Javascript (run JS files).
- Beta: Clickscript Runtime + Compile from Clickscript to Binary.
- Post v1: Add Python transpile support.
- Commercial Version: Import legacy .py and .js files into Clickscript. Cloud/real-time work environement/IDE for no-coders and engineers to work collaboratively.
- Beyond: 
    * Add support for more languages
    * Built in package manager + extensions
