# Clickscript

Clickscript (currently a work in progress) is a new, general purpose, visual programming language that allows non-coders to build software right along with software engineers that code.

Clickscript produces high grade, easy to follow code in various languages (starting with Python then NodeJS) allowing developers to pick up right where no-coders left off and vice-versa.

## Our Mission

If we are going to live in an ever growing digital & automated world, everyone is going to need to participate in building it. With ~28M software developers but ~5B software users, there is a massive chance of large future unemployment and minimal innovation if more builders cannot join the current builders in tech. Our mission is grand, and there's a large chance of failure, but someone has to try it. :) 

## Roadmap
- v0: Runtime and UI for building and running Clickscript files.
- v1: Transpile Clickscript scripts into Python and/or NodeJS.
- Commercial Version: Import legacy .py and .js files into Clickscript
- Beyond: Add support for more languages.
