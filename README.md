# Clickscript

Clickscript (currently a work in progress) is a new, general purpose, visual programming language that allows non-coders to build software right along with software engineers that code.

Clickscript produces high grade, easy to follow code in various languages (starting with Python then NodeJS) allowing developers to pick up right where no-coders left off and vice-versa.

## Roadmap
- v0: Runtime and UI for building and running Clickscript files.
- v1: Transpile Clickscript scripts into Python and/or NodeJS.
- Commercial Version: Import legacy .py and .js files into Clickscript
- Beyond: Add support for more languages.
