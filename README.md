# Clickscript

Clickscript (currently a work in progress) is a new, general purpose, visual programming language that allows no-coders to build software right along with software engineers that code.

Clickscript produces high grade, easy to follow code in various languages (starting with Python then NodeJS) allowing developers to pick up right where no-coders left off and vice-versa.
