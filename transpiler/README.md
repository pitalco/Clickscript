# Clickscript
**Clickscript** is a visual programming language that allows non-developers (no-coders) to develop right alongside developers. Clickscript produces high grade, easy to follow code in various languages (starting with Python then NodeJS) allowing developers to pick up right where no-coders left off and vice-versa.

This is the Golang binary for compiling/transpiling Clickscript files to various programming languages.

## Run In Dev
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Build Binary
```bash
make install
```

## CLI
```bash
clicksd compile [clickscript file name] [language to compile to]
```

## Contributing

Clickscript is completely modular allowing others to add new functionality easily. Docs for this are coming soon!
